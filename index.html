          <h2><strong><FONT COLOR=black>Synopsis</strong></FONT></h2>
          <p><strong>CREST is a pioneering initiative led by Michigan State University to develop a Digital Twin (DT) of the Earth system, focusing on Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus and disaster risk management. Our vision is to develop a DT, informed by convergent research among faculty from six different colleges at MSU, and one that can be scaled and transferred to any region on Earth. Our goal is to transform how societies assess and manage WEF systems and enhance resilience to growing extreme events. We also aim to use the DT framework to develop spinoff tools for disaster risk management and early warning.</strong>
          <br>
          <h2><strong><FONT COLOR=black>Background and Rationale</strong></FONT></h2>
        </p>Sustainably managing WEF in the face of intensified hydrologic extremes such as floods and droughts is not only a global challenge but also an increasingly urgent local priority, including in the Great Lakes region. While this region benefits from abundant freshwater, shifting rainfall patterns and growing climate extremes are already affecting communities and farmers. Meanwhile, other regions, such as the Colorado River basin, are facing acute water shortages that disrupt water supplies, agriculture, and energy production. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration that goes beyond traditional disciplinary silos.</p>
        </p>Our initial focus will be the Asian Water Tower (AWT), a vast and vulnerable region supplying water to over 25% of the world’s population. With its complex geography, hydrology, and climate, the AWT serves as an ideal testbed for developing and piloting the DT framework. The region is experiencing intensified hydrologic extremes, rapid glacier melt, and mounting land and water use pressures, all of which have cascading effects on agriculture, energy, and the environment. These effects reverberate globally, shaping migration, trade, and environmental security, including in regions like the Great Lakes. Our rationale is simple: if MSU can develop the horsepower to digitally twin a system as complex as the AWT, we can demonstrate the capability to adapt the platform to other regions, including the Great Lakes.</p>
        </p>CREST’s key innovation is the DT framework, an interactive, web-based platform that leverages the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), integrating satellite data, process-based models (e.g., hydrology, agriculture, ecosystems), and socioeconomic information. This powerful tool will help decision-makers—from governments to community planners—visualize real-time risks, forecast future conditions, and evaluate “what-if” scenarios related to external shocks, infrastructure changes, or policy shifts. What sets our approach apart is the integration of both natural and human systems, bridging hydrology, agriculture, and engineering with policy and governance to ensure that proposed solutions are not only scientifically sound but also socially viable.</p>
        </p>CREST also has strong commercialization potential, especially to develop early warning systems and decision-support tools that will be attractive to governments, NGOs, and the private sector. By attracting global attention to CREST, we will ensure that its power can be applied in Michigan and other regions facing WEF security challenges and complex environmental issues. CREST is a “high-risk, high-reward” platform for innovation, and a launchpad for substantial return on investment and global leadership in the long term.</p>
